This is a very simple 3D racing game made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, WebGL, and GLSL.

* Open a terminal in the root folder.
* Type `git clone https://github.com/YourZombieMop/race-webgl`.

### Run the project:
* Open a terminal in the root folder.
* Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the terminal.
